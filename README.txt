Setup:

Put Assembly-CSharp.dll in Steam/steamapps/common/Ori DE/oriDE_Data/Managed
Rename one of the seeds to "randomizer.dat", put it in Steam/steamapps/common/Ori DE

CovertMuffin has a great video guide on setting up the randomizer here: https://youtu.be/0O8_o4nxd_o

Notes:

If you get stuck, use Alt+R to send yourself back to glades. Wall jump, double jump, and post ginso escape are all possible sticking points (you will be able to get into swamp without doing the ginso escape, at some point). Don't use Alt+R while you're in a locked room (sein fronkey fight, ginso miniboss, etc.) or you will probably be softlocked.

OOBs, timed level ups, and sorrow bash will not be required. Stomping cflame walls from the right may be required. Luring enemies to bash and break barriers may be required. The first energy cell and sein are not randomized.

Hint messages will pop up at the top of the screen to show you what you are getting. The text boxes at skill trees don't represent what they're actually giving you. If you pick something up that doesn't show a hint, it was either blocked by another message or I missed that item.

In the menu, clean water is represented by warmth. The actual warmth event has no effect. After you have clean water, the poison water visuals will not change but you'll be able to swim in it.


COMMANDS:

Alt+T or Alt+P:     Replay last pickup message
Alt+R:              Teleport Ori to the start of the game
                    Warning: using this in misty or locked rooms can potentially softlock
Alt+L:              Reload the seed file (use to change seeds without restarting the game)
Alt+C:              Toggle Chaos Mode
Alt+V:              Within Chaos Mode, toggle messages
Alt+F:              Within Chaos Mode, force an effect to spawn



CHAOS MODE?

I recommend just trying it out once before reading this section. Alt+C toggles it on and off -- when toggling off, all effects will be removed immediately.

Chaos mode spawns random effects at intervals of 5-15 seconds. The duration varies by effect, but is in the range of 5-60 seconds (thus, multiple effects can occur simultaneously). Possible effects include:

Fast movement speed
Slow movement speed
Ice physics on the ground
Max speed increase
Randomized acceleration/max speed values between ground/air
Gravity increase/decrease
Gravity direction change
Gravity well (within 20 units of Ori)
Short range teleportation
Long range teleportation
Camera zoom in/out
Temporary poison
Invisibility
Damage vulnerability/resistance
Random velocity vectors

The randomness of chaos mode is based on the system clock instead of a set seed, thus will vary between players playing the same seed and between plays of a seed. This mode is intended for fun and to feel the joy of getting teleported out of bounds while you're stuck in a cutscene. I recommend saving a lot.
