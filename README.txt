Setup:

Put Assembly-CSharp.dll in Steam/steamapps/common/Ori DE/oriDE_Data/Managed
Rename one of the seeds to "randomizer.dat", put it in Steam/steamapps/common/Ori DE

Notes:

If you get stuck, use Alt+R to send yourself back to glades. Wall jump, double jump, and post ginso escape are all possible sticking points (you will be able to get into swamp without doing the ginso escape, at some point). Don't use Alt+R while you're in a locked room (sein fronkey fight, ginso miniboss, etc.) or you will probably be softlocked.

If you need to replay the last pickup message, press Alt+T.

OOBs and fronkey walk are not required. Sorrow bash is not required. Stomping cflame walls from the right may be required. The first energy cell and sein are not randomized.

Hint messages will pop up at the top of the screen to show you what you are getting. The text boxes at skill trees don't represent what they're actually giving you. If you pick something up that doesn't show a hint, it was either blocked by another message or I missed that item.

In the menu, clean water is represented by warmth. The actual warmth event has no effect. After you have clean water, the poison water visuals will not change but you'll be able to swim in it.
