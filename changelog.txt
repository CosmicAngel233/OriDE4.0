-The Sunstone now requires 2/3 shards instead of 3/5
-The Gumon Seal is now included in shards mode
-Limitkeys now includes the Gumon Seal in its restrictions
-If Misty Woods is not in its initial state, Alt+R will change it into the first revisit state. As a result, the 1st, 3rd, and 4th keystones in Misty are now in the drop pool again. The 2nd keystone becomes inaccessible if you Alt+R out of Misty before collecting it, thus, it will always just be a 100 exp orb.

-Alt+P replays the last message (same as Alt+T -- if you don't want to accidentally hit Alt+R)
