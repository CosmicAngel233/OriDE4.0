v2.0

Logic changes:

-The 100 exp under the drain in swamp is now considered accessible without full swamp access
-The 100 exp in the water at the valley entrance now has a chance of being Bash
-The 100 exp on the valley entry tree is now accessible with only Wall Jump
-Accessing "Raziel No" with only Climb has been removed from standard and added to expert
-Entering swamp using Bash to manipulate the frog (as per the All Skills route) is now in standard
-Some items on the left side of Gumo's Hideout are now considered accessible without vertical movement if you have access from the blackroot connection
-Charge Jump can now substitute for one of Glide/Double Jump for accessing Horu
-Navigating Horu with Bash+Grenade has been added to expert
-Entering valley in expert now requires only one of Stomp or Bash
-Entering sorrow by charge jumping along the spikes is now in expert
-Expert mode no longer requires doublebashing

Clues mode:

-New alternative mode for easing the key hunt (as do shards and limitkeys)
-For each 3 skill trees activated, a random (based on seed) key will have its location revealed by "show progress" (default Alt+P)
-Locations displayed are based on the area the item counts towards for % completion - for example, the room of the death gauntlet next to glades is treated as grove, and the 2 orbs in the upper left part of valley are treated as sorrow.

Item changes:

-The damage of spirit flame upgrade has been reduced from +2 to +1
-The frequency of mega health and mega energy has been reduced from 5 to 3
-Added teleporter activation items for Forlorn, Grotto, Sorrow, Grove, Swamp, and Valley

Miscellaneous:

-A web-based version of the seed generator is now available at https://sigmasin.github.io/OriDERandomizer
-Spoiler files now have more clear formatting
-Alt+R uses a lower position
-Alt+R can no longer warp displace
-Alt+R will now always reset misty
-Hint messages are now color-coded:
    Green: skills
    Blue: water vein, clean water
    Yellow: gumon seal, wind
    Red: sunstone, warmth

v1.3

-Alt+R is now disabled when inputlocked or carrying an object
-The mini-iceless jump used in any% to get through swamp has been removed from normal and added to extended
-Entering the grenade tree room with only doublejump or grenade+bash has been added to extended
-A logic path, "extreme", has been added. This includes multiple damage boosts across spikes, use of triple jump, and use of ultra defense to damage boost
-The preset previously called "normal" (normal, speed, lure, dboost-light) has been renamed to "standard"
-The preset previously called "extended" (normal, speed, lure, dboost, dboost-light, cdash, dbash, extended, extended-damage) has been renamed to "expert"
-A preset has been added: "master" (normal, speed, lure, dboost, dboost-light, dboost-hard, cdash, dbash, extended, extended-damage, lure-hard, extreme)
-An argument "--prefer-path-difficulty (easy,hard)" has been added. With this set, the generator will lean towards placing skills and keys at more convenient locations (on easy) or more inconvenient locations (on hard)
-The first line of a seed file will now store more information about the arguments used to create it

v1.2

Bonus powerups:

-Grenade power upgrade radius reduced
-Charge flame efficiency and grenade power upgrade have been merged into "Explosion Power Upgrade". This also increases the damage of charge flame.
-Spirit flame damage/targets upgrades are now combined
-Health efficiency and energy efficiency have been removed

Seed generation:

-Shards mode has been changed to require 3/5 shards rather than 2/3.
-By default, the pickups from map stones are now progressive, meaning that the item you get from a map stone is not tied to the location of the map stone, but rather the total number of fragments you have returned. This obsoletes the strategy of saving before placing a fragment and reloading if the item is not useful. The seed generator now has a flag "--non-progressive-mapstones" which will make map stones behave as they did in 1.1
-Experience values are now randomized during seed generation, and tend to scale up as more areas become accessible. The seed generator now has a flag "--exp-pool" to set the total experience available
-A new flag, "--force-trees" has been added. With this flag set, Ori will be unable to enter the final escape until all skill trees have been visited.

Miscellaneous:

-Door warping to get the experience orb at the bottom of Horu is now in extended logic
-The health efficiency and energy efficiency abilities from the utility tree now affect regeneration
-The randomizer will now auto-generate a file, "RandomizerBindings.txt", which can be used to reassign randomizer functions
-A command has been added to show current skill tree and shard progress - default Alt+P

v1.1

-Fixed some path bugs and key-lock situations
-Charge dash is no longer expected in Glades or Blackroot after finding dash early in extended mode
-Shards can no longer appear inside their own dungeons
-The Sunstone now requires 2/3 shards instead of 3/5
-The Gumon Seal is now included in shards mode
-Limitkeys now includes the Gumon Seal in its restrictions
-If Misty Woods is not in its initial state, Alt+R will change it into the first revisit state. As a result, the 1st, 3rd, and 4th keystones in Misty are now in the drop pool again. The 2nd keystone becomes inaccessible if you Alt+R out of Misty before collecting it, thus, it will always just be a 100 exp orb.

v1.0.1

-Fix "replay last message" not displaying properly

v1.0

-Using mapstones from the far edges will no longer fail to give a pickup
-Picking up an energy cell will no longer remove mega energy

-Added several additional flags to the seed generator:
--starved: Reduces the rate at which skills appear when not required to progress
--shards: Splits the Water Vein into 3 shards and the Sunstone into 5. Collecting 2 Water Vein shards or 3 Sunstone shards will award the item.
--limitkeys: Causes the Water Vein and Sunstone to only appear at event sources or skill trees
-Alt+P replays the last message (same as Alt+T -- if you don't want to accidentally hit Alt+R)
-Alt+C toggles "Chaos Mode"
-Alt+V toggles messages when in Chaos Mode
-Alt+F forces a chaos effect to spawn

-Map stones are now item sources, activated by returning a map stone fragment

    -normal: all the standard ways to do things

    -timed-level: requires a timed levelup to pull off
    -glitched: heaven help you
